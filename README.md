# Obstacle Avoiding Bluetooth Car with Gyroscopic Sensor and Voice Control
The main objective behind the project is to create a working model of Arduino driven car that can be operated both directly( while connected to the laptop) and indirectly (via Bluetooth) and get back intended feedback in form of data such as distance from nearest object, speed and displacement as when compared to its initial conditions.
